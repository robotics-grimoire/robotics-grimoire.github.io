There isn't much to say about myself: I work hard and find myself fascinated by the world. I have a habit of striving for a way to automate everything around me (to a certain limit), trying to find more clever ways of achieving goals. Because of that, I have a deep interest in understanding *intelligence* at all levels: data analysis, robotics, multi-agent systems, all of it! My wife and family worry about two things: that I push myself too hard, and that I come off as showing off. In my opinion, I really don't think I'm that special -- rather, I've just worked to have opportunities to do special things.

No, I am not a CMU graduate -- I have a humble BSE from the University of Pittsburgh. But even with that, I've been published, helped field amazing projects, teach/mentor, and have forays into entrepreneurialism. At the moment, I am working towards a MSE at my *alma mater* (though my teacher [Dr. Zhi-Hong Mao](https://www.pitt.edu/~zhm4) feels I should just get my PhD). This is a challenge always: I do enjoy discovering new things, but my drive is towards the practical rather than the esoteric. As I advertise myself: Yes, I understand the *theory*, but I also understand how to overcome the assumptions and limitations around it. This is often confused with "integration" because it sounds like I'm taking original work and using it in a specific circumstance. But integration is focused on information flow and overall stability, not in engineering solutions to the edge-cases.

Other than my technical activities, I am also an avid astronomer and bonsai enthusiast. Both of these activities gives me immense pleasure, and the acts of observation and engagement are not things to be automated!

Please feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn or through the site email: robotics.grimoire@gmail.com. I'm glad to discuss anything involving my chosen profession and hobbies!
