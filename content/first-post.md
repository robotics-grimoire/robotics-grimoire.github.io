And So It Begins (Again)...
========================================================================================================================
I've never been great at maintaining a blog. In my mind, a good blog is updated periodically and has some common theme, and I've never been disciplined enough for either. There's always another interest that's worth investigating, and there's always another event that preempts my schedule.
