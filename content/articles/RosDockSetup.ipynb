    "There are a lot of tutorials out there about how to set up and use [ROS](https://www.ros.org). But all of them assume that the intention is to have ROS take over the default environment. This becomes very problematic when you only have one development machine and are working on a lot of other projects -- dependency conflicts are one of the main pain-points when using ROS.\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution is to consider containerizing your development environments. While virtual machines have their place in this solution, it's typically not viable because robotics development is focused on as near real-time performance as possible. Like ROS, [Docker](https://www.docker.com) has enjoyed a lot of success and has an equally rich set of tutorials; most are focused around deployment of some web service. It gives you the advantage of using the actual system hardware while simply tricking the environment its running upon. But Docker can be challenging to ensure grapical applications (like [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org)) function properly.\n",

    "\n",
    "It's recommended that you reboot the system at this point. Most tutorials and Docker's own documentation says log out and back in again, but a refresh of the running state can shake out other issues. After rebooting, you should be able to re-run the `hello-world` container without needing root privilege."
