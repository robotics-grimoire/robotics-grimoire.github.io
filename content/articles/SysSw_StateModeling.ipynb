Rather, it's to show that the concept of *state* is a embedded in a wide range of structures. But first, let's try to define what's meant by state itself."

    "A lot of things seem to work that way: a light bulb filament gives off light proportionate to the energy applied to it. This lack of statefulness implies *time invariance*: It doesn't matter when energy is applied, the filament gives off light.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a convenient way to understand systems. This is how *data driven* systems are designed: Data goes in, transformed data comes out. But time invariance places specific requirements on the inputs themselves. When such a system is given an *impulse*, it changes its response only then and provides a transient response afterwards (which can include no response at all!). Take for example listening to the radio: if the signal is disrupted, but what if we don't want the music to abruptly stop? Many streaming services have *buffering* built into them to cache the stream so that disruptions in the signal are masked by the buffer itself. In a sense, this buffer cache is providing a state to the application: as long as it isn't empty, normal operations can progress!\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital control systems are usually designed considering that the input signal may be *latent* or *dropped* an update, but they still have requirements to produce their output following some periodic. Because of this, a lot of signal processing implementations follow this model."

This simple model guarantees a data rate of at-least the timer rate, which is applicable in a lot of design circumstances. But the internal **state** of the controller changes based on the trigger because the logic for when no new data is available will activate or deactivate based on the trigger."

    "Now that we can see that software can be described as having a *runtime state*, what then is the difference between this and a machine? Concisely, a **state machine** is a construct which *senses* events/triggers, then *follows* a pre-defined set of rules governing transition, and finally *executes* a specific set of system behaviors which may provide an additional trigger. This is a nuanced definition, and we'll explore the differences between a stateful system versus a state machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key differentiation here is that something has to reconcile **ALL** events/triggers. In design, it isn't sufficient if some parts can detect a trigger (like the wrapping try-catch in the listing above). For example, in *Listing 1*, immediately after calling `connect()` with each of the interfaces, the program immediately transitions into the execution loop without any evaluation of events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another differentiator is that **state machines are a software design pattern**! *Listing 1* is purposefully implemented naively to highlight the anti-pattern. To maintain flexibility, the insertion or removal of a state and its associated triggers **should not** require a redesign of the underlying code. This design pattern isn't unique (it often is implemented via other equally flexible design patterns), but let's explore one of these."
